ðŸ˜„ About me: In 2020, I attended Hackbright Academy and discovered I loved the backend! I am a backend infra engineer by day and a student by night. I have loved my time in tech, and am hoping pursuing a post bacc CS degree will help fill in some gaps of knowledge I have with CS fundamentals. In upcoming classes, I will be posting more school projects to my personal Github account! <br>
âœ¨ Right now at work I am currently learning how to make Grafana dashboards. This summer I am taking a data structures course. <br>
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: really any books or articles you recommend on microservices architecture. I started reading Designing Data Intensive Applications this year and it's been great learning about database modeling, batch processing, and stream processing.
