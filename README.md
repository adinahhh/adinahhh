😄 About me: In 2020, I attended Hackbright Academy and discovered I loved the backend! I am a backend infra engineer by day and a student by night. I have loved my time in tech, and am hoping pursuing a post bacc CS degree will help fill in some gaps of knowledge I have with CS fundamentals. In upcoming classes, I will be posting more school projects to my personal Github account!
✨ Right now at work I am currently learning how to make Grafana dashboards. In school, I am relearning python fundamentals and discrete math. 
🤔 I’m looking for help with: really any books or articles you recommend on microservices architecture. I started reading Designing Data Intensive Applications this year and it's been great learning about database modeling, batch processing, and stream processing.
